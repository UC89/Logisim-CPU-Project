# Logisim-CPU-Project
This was the final project for my CS502 class. The objective of this project is to create a cpu from different circuit elements and logical gates that can run most MIPS instructions.
-To run this project you must run the CPU-CIRC.circ file on <a href='http://www.cburch.com/logisim/'>Logisim</a>.
